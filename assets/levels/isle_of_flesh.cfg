name="Welcome to the Isle of Flesh"
desc="After a long journey, you have finally reached the shores of the
Isle of Flesh. You scan the beach for signs of life and see none,
yet the hairs on your neck stand up and you feel as though you
are being watched.

Will you dock your vessel on the BEACH in plain sight? Or will
you SAIL further around the island and find a safer alternative?"
options=[
	{"text":"Beach", "goto":"beach"},
	{"text":"Sail", "goto":"sail"}
]

[beach]
name="The Beach"
desc="With the last of your strength you manage to reach the shore in
your little boat.
As you step onto the beach, your feet immediately start sinking!

Nearby is a large, sturdy-looking ROCK and a decidedly unsturdy-looking
piece of WOOD. Which will you grab hold of?"
options=[
	{"text":"Rock","goto":"rock","actions":[["add","injury"]]},
	{"text":"Wood","goto":"wood"}
]

[rock]
desc="You grasp firmly onto a protrusion on the side of the rock and,
with superhuman effort, manage to heave yourself out of the quicksand
to safety.
As you lie on the rock catching your breath, you realize that
your hands are now quite badly cut.
[Added INJURY to inventory.]
You use a nearby stick to check the beach for sinkholes as you
carefully make your way up the sand and onto the presumed safety
of solid earth. You toss the stick aside, and when you look back
from watching its graceful arc you notice a grand wooden door
before you. How did you miss that, you wonder?
Chalking it up to the fatigue of travel and near-death experiences,
you ponder the door. 

Clearly what you seek lies beyond, but will
you KNOCK and announce your presence or ENTER boldly?"
options=[
	{"text":"Knock","goto":"door_knock"},
	{"text":"Enter","goto":"door_enter"}
]

[door_knock]
desc="You clench your jaw in determination, poised to do the deed...and
falter. You realize you have not knocked on a door since you were
three years old, and have quite forgotten how. 

Will you use your FOOT, your HEAD, or your FIST?"
options=[
	{"text":"Foot","goto":"knock_foot"},
	{"text":"Head","goto":"knock_head"},
	{"text":"Fist","goto":"knock_fist"}
]

[knock_foot]
desc="Well, God may have made feet to work the gas pedal, but surely
they can do double duty as presence-at-the-door announcers. You
reel your foot back so far that you pull something, and let it
fly.
It makes beautiful contact with the bottom of the door, and
that's when you discover that this door has the unique ability
to rotate vertically at the midpoint. The force of your kickage
sends the upper half of the door careening into your skull, and
your skull into your ribcage, and so on.

Death comes for us all! Take-backsies?"

	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[knock_head]
desc="It's all coming back to you! Didn't Mom always say to 'use your
head'?
With a smile befitting one of your supreme intelligence you
smash your face into the unforgiving wood as soundly as you can
muster. The door doesn't budge, and thanks to your newfound head
trauma neither will you. Whoops.

You have deceased! Take another crack at it?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[knock_fist]
desc="As you call upon the powers that be, the knowledge you need springs
forth from the depths of your mind palace: you're supposed to
knock with your fist.
You do so, and it makes a satisfying squish as you are pulled
through the once-solid door and into the deathly stillness beyon.
You take a step forward and call out into the dark abyss. None
answer. You take another step but find only air beneath your feet!
You slide on your bum-bum down a slippery slope and land on
a squishy pile.

In the near silence of the cave, you hear breathing. Do you MOVE
or WAIT?"
options=[
	{"text":"move","goto":"cave_move"},
	{"text":"wait","goto":"cave_wait","actions":[["increment","waited_in_cave"]]}
]

[cave_move]
desc="You struggle to stand on the mass beneath you but eventually succeed.
The breathing doesn't change pace and you decide it's sleeping.
You grope blindly for a wall or anything to help hold you up,
but still manage to walk forward and step onto hard rock.
You walk slowly for a while, and though the cavern floor is relatively
flat you still find yourself tripping every so often in the sheer
blackness.
Suddenly, you see light up ahead! You continue onward and
discover a vast chamber, the walls of which seem to be made of
slimy, pulsating, and slightly glowing...flesh? Hm.

The flesh calls to you, and you marvel at its beauty. Will you
COVER your ears or SING its hauntingly beautiful song?"
options=[
	{"text":"Cover ears","goto":"flesh_cover_ears"},
	{"text":"Sing", "goto":"flesh_sing"}
]

[flesh_cover_ears]
desc="You cover your ears, but the singing grows louder. You have rejected
the message of the Flesh, and you will pay.
The song grows to an unbearable pitch. You clutch your head
as it feels like it's about to burst, and you wish that the singing
would stop. In the end, the darkness takes you. Mercifully, the
cavern's unearthly song doesn't follow you into the beyond.

Try again?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[flesh_sing]
desc="You smile as the song of the Flesh surrounds you. At long last,
you've found what you sought. The cradle of untold power, and
the source of the darkest and most incomprehensible forces in
the earth, scarcely known by even those who have strayed furthest
from their humanity.
You raise your voice in song, and feel the glistening walls resonate
in harmony. They have accepted your voice, and you will join them.
None can stop you.

You win! But would you follow this path again, knowing where it led?"
options=[
	{"text":"Return to where it all began","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
