[start]
name="Welcome to the Isle of Flesh"
desc="After a long journey, you have finally reached the shores of the Isle of Flesh. You scan the beach for signs of life and see none, yet the hairs on your neck stand up and you feel as though you are being watched.

Will you dock your vessel on the BEACH in plain sight? Or will you SAIL further around the island and find a safer alternative?"
options=[
	{"text":"Beach", "goto":"beach"},
	{"text":"Sail", "goto":"sail"}
]

[beach]
name="The Beach"
desc="With the last of your strength you manage to reach the shore in your little boat.
As you step onto the beach, your feet immediately start sinking!

Nearby is a large, sturdy-looking ROCK and a decidedly unsturdy-looking piece of WOOD. Which will you grab hold of?"
options=[
	{"text":"Rock","goto":"rock","actions":[["add","injury"]]},
	{"text":"Wood","goto":"wood"}
]

[rock]
desc="You grasp firmly onto a protrusion on the side of the rock and, with superhuman effort, manage to heave yourself out of the quicksand to safety.
As you lie on the rock catching your breath, you realize that your hands are now quite badly cut.
[Added INJURY to inventory.]
You use a nearby stick to check the beach for sinkholes as you carefully make your way up the sand and onto the presumed safety of solid earth. You toss the stick aside, and when you look back from watching its graceful arc you notice a grand wooden door before you. How did you miss that, you wonder?
Chalking it up to the fatigue of travel and near-death experiences, you ponder the door. 

Clearly what you seek lies beyond, but will you KNOCK and announce your presence or ENTER boldly?"
options=[
	{"text":"Knock","goto":"door_knock"},
	{"text":"Enter","goto":"door_enter"}
]

[door_knock]
desc="You clench your jaw in determination, poised to do the deed...and falter. You realize you have not knocked on a door since you were three years old, and have quite forgotten how. 

Will you use your FOOT, your HEAD, or your FIST?"
options=[
	{"text":"Foot","goto":"knock_foot"},
	{"text":"Head","goto":"knock_head"},
	{"text":"Fist","goto":"knock_fist"}
]

[knock_foot]
desc="Well, God may have made feet to work the gas pedal, but surely they can do double duty as presence-at-the-door announcers. You reel your foot back so far that you pull something, and let it fly.
It makes beautiful contact with the bottom of the door, and that's when you discover that this door has the unique ability to rotate vertically at the midpoint. The force of your kickage sends the upper half of the door careening into your skull, and your skull into your ribcage, and so on.

Death comes for us all! Take-backsies?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[knock_head]
desc="It's all coming back to you! Didn't Mom always say to 'use your head'?
With a smile befitting one of your supreme intelligence you smash your face into the unforgiving wood as soundly as you can muster. The door doesn't budge, and thanks to your newfound head trauma neither will you. Whoops.

You have deceased! Take another crack at it?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[knock_fist]
desc="As you call upon the powers that be, the knowledge you need springs forth from the depths of your mind palace: you're supposed to knock with your fist.
You do so, and it makes a satisfying squish as you are pulled through the once-solid door and into the deathly stillness beyond.
You take a step forward and call out into the dark abyss. None answer. You take another step but find only air beneath your feet! You slide on your bum-bum down a slippery slope and land on a squishy pile.

In the near silence of the cave, you hear breathing. Do you MOVE or WAIT?"
options=[
	{"text":"move","goto":"cave_move"},
	{"text":"wait","goto":"cave_wait_1","actions":[["add","waited_in_cave"]]}
]

[cave_move]
desc="You struggle to stand on the mass beneath you but eventually succeed. The breathing doesn't change pace and you decide it's sleeping.
You grope blindly for a wall or anything to help hold you up, but still manage to walk forward and step onto hard rock. You walk slowly for a while, and though the cavern floor is relatively flat you still find yourself tripping every so often in the sheer
blackness.
Suddenly, you see light up ahead! You continue onward and discover a vast chamber, the walls of which seem to be made of slimy, pulsating, and slightly glowing...flesh? Hm.

The flesh calls to you, and you marvel at its beauty. Will you COVER your ears or SING its hauntingly beautiful song?"
options=[
	{"text":"Cover ears","goto":"flesh_cover_ears"},
	{"text":"Sing", "goto":"flesh_sing"}
]

[flesh_cover_ears]
desc="You cover your ears, but the singing grows louder. You have rejected the message of the Flesh, and you will pay.
The song grows to an unbearable pitch. You clutch your head as it feels like it's about to burst, and you wish that the singing would stop. In the end, the darkness takes you. Mercifully, the cavern's unearthly song doesn't follow you into the beyond.

Try again?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[flesh_sing]
desc="You smile as the song of the Flesh surrounds you. At long last, you've found what you sought. The cradle of untold power, and the source of the darkest and most incomprehensible forces in the earth, scarcely known by even those who have strayed furthest from their humanity.
You raise your voice in song, and feel the glistening walls resonate in harmony. They have accepted your voice, and you will join them. None can stop you.

You win! But would you follow this path again, knowing where it led?"
options=[
	{"text":"Return to where it all began","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[door_enter]
desc="Who's afraid of a little death and despair? You don't know the meaning of fear, and it's not just because you have only a second-grade education. You shove the door with the triumphant air, but deflate slightly upon realizing that it opens with a handle.
You utilize this newfound knowledge, and the door creaks open.
You step forward only to find yourself in blackness. You take another step but find only air beneath your feet! You slide on your bum-bum down a slippery slope and land on
a squishy pile.

In the near silence of the cave, you hear breathing. Do you MOVE or WAIT?"
options=[
	{"text":"move","goto":"cave_move"},
	{"text":"wait","goto":"cave_wait_1","actions":[["add","waited_in_cave"]]}
]

[cave_wait_1]
desc="Too scared to move in case you wake whatever slumbers, you stay perfectly still.

Nothing happens.

In the near silence of the cave, you hear breathing. Do you MOVE or WAIT?"
options=[
	{"text":"move","goto":"cave_move"},
	{"text":"wait","goto":"cave_wait_2","actions":[["add","waited_in_cave"]]}
]

[cave_wait_2]
desc="You continue to remain motionless. Maybe it's your nerves, but you feel yourself sweating profusely and becoming light-headed.

In the near silence of the cave, you hear breathing. Do you MOVE or WAIT?"
options=[
	{"text":"move","goto":"cave_move"},
	{"text":"wait","goto":"cave_wait_3","actions":[["add","waited_in_cave"]]}
]

[cave_wait_3]
desc="Surely the darkness isn't such a bad thing? You allow it to embrace you as you slip away. If they ever find your corpse, hopefully they'll think you were braver than you really were, you dingus.

Try again?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[wood]
desc="Welp, if that was a test (and it sort of was, I told you that wood didn't look sturdy :/ ) then you failed with flying colors! You lift the driftwood easily and it joins you in a gritty grave.
Try again?"
options=[
	{"text":"Try again","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Quit","actions":[["quit"]]}
]

[sail]
desc="You know, if you'd bothered to pay extra for the Premium Version of the island map, you would have had some advance warning about the massive whirlpools protecting every bit of it except the beach that you so wisely avoided. Maybe your ghost can warn the next
cheapskate.
A watery grave is your prize! Gone before your time. Redo?"
options=[
	{"text":"Might as well","goto":"start"},
	{"text":"Sink","actions":[["quit"]]}
]
